# Hamiltonian Snake
Game of snake which plays itself based off the algorithm-generated hamiltonian circuit. 
This odd snake game is not like the others. In this game you are not the player, rather an observer of 
this perfectionist snake as it continuously follows a specific generated circuit which is unique with 
each game. Behind the scenes, the program is generating a Hamiltonian Circuit which the snake will continuously follow 
until it fills out the board. An average full game takes around 6.5 minutes in order to get 400 apples 
and to turn into a 20x20 square.
